# outreach
A repository for coordinating outreach activities which are focused on:

1) Disseminating reliable information as widely as possible
2) Inspiring people to change their behaviour
3) Building the credibility of Flatten the Curve

Current activities  are:

1) Clarifying our central audiences and messages in all communications (today: the homepage)
2) Building our capacity to send dynamic updates to website subscribers (today: sending out first newsletter)
3) Ramping up social media efforts to make it easy for contributors to spread the word (today: process for generating tweets, FB page, SEO next steps)
---------------------------------------

This section documents our outreach activities for new contributors:

# Narratives
This will be a pivotal part of our inspiring people to change their behaviour. We have not done much work on this. It needs dedicated effort.

# Website subscriptions
We currently have over 11,000 people subscribed to a newsletter. On March 21, we sent a survey to 100 people (at random) to understand who they are and how they would like to engage with the website. Results here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P9981rN6WLzUZbATNF168Utqdc8RaUFHofoMBflZ0ZQ/edit#slide=id.g81c0e6c86a_0_126

We are setting up a Mailchimp account to send out our first newsletter update as well as working on enabling people to subscribe to the latest reliable actions as well as updates in specific languages/regions.
